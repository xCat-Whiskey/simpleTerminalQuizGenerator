No GUI just TERMI

There are known bugs such as answers replicating inside the answer section. I've been working with such large lists that this has not really been a problem. However, you will notice the problem once you test the sample, if you do.

To follow the sheet:

Line 1: Question
Line 2: Answer
Line 3: Question
Line 4: Answer

How the code is written is line after line. 
So, questions is whatever % 2 != 0, whereas modulus for answers is 0. 
Anyways, if you needed something simple and easy, here you are. Enjoy.
