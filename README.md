No GUI just TERMI

I originally created this to learn the definitions of terms I need to know for classes.

There are known bugs such as answers replicating inside the answer section. I've been working with such large lists that this has not really been a problem. However, you will notice the problem once you test the sample, if you do.

To follow the sheet:

View (RAW)
• Line 1: Question 
• Line 2: Answer 
• Line 3: Question 
• Line 4: Answer 

How the code is written is line after line. 
So, questions is whatever % 2 != 0, whereas modulus for answers is 0. 
Anyways, if you needed something simple and easy, here you are. Enjoy.
